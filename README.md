🔐 **Cyberattack Data Analysis in IoT Environments**
This project analyzes large-scale IoT cyberattacks using the CICIoT2023 dataset and Big Data tools like Hadoop and Hive. It uncovers attack patterns, protocol vulnerabilities, and flag behaviors to enhance IoT network security.

📂 **Dataset**
Source: CICIoT2023 - Kaggle
Size: 12.5 GB
Attacks: 33 types across 7 categories (DDoS, DoS, Recon, Web-based, etc.)

⚙️ **Stack**
Apache Hadoop (3.3.3) | HDFS | HiveQL
Power BI, Excel for Visualizations
Git Bash, Databricks (for preprocessing/EDA)

📊 **Key Insights**
1. DDoS-ICMP Flood: Most frequent attack (72.75%)
2. TCP & ICMP: Most targeted protocols
3. SYN, FIN, ACK Flags: Common in flooding attacks
4. Long Duration Attacks: MITM, Brute Force
5. Web-based attacks: Least frequent

🧠 **Impact**
- Reveals critical patterns in IoT network vulnerabilities
- Supports development of smarter detection systems
